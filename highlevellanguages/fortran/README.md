# Discordian Calendar

Naturally, we divide the year into five seasons of 73 days each. Each season is made up of 5 weeks of 5 days.

## Seasons and Days (Or Whatever We Call Them)

In our grand scheme of redefining time, we've sliced the year into five equally perplexing seasons, each sporting 73 days. Why 73? Because why not. These seasons are aptly named Chaos, Discord, Confusion, Bureaucracy, and The Aftermath. As for the days of the week, we've spiced things up with names like Sweetmorn, Boomtime, Pungenday, Prickle-Prickle, and Setting Orange. If you think these names sound like they were conjured up during a late-night snack run, you're probably not wrong.

## Technology Stack

In the spirit of making choices that might raise eyebrows, I opted for Fortran over Pascal. Why? Maybe it was the influence of a pack of cold hotdogs I devoured. Or perhaps it's because Fortran has that vintage charm that screams "I'm doing things my way." Plus, let's be honest, nothing says 'chaos' like programming in a language older than the hills, right?

## Why This Exists

You might wonder, "Why does this exist?" And to that, I say, why does anything exist? Maybe it's for those who've ever wanted to schedule a meeting on Prickle-Prickle and watch the world burn. Or maybe it's just because we can. In the world of Discordianism, it's all about embracing the unusual, the whimsical, and yes, sometimes the downright illogical. So, here's to the calendar that refuses to conform, just like us.
